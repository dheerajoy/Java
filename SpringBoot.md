## pom.xml â€“ Project Object Model

The pom.xml (Project Object Model) is the heart of a Maven project. It defines the project's configuration, dependencies, build process, and other vital information. The pom.xml file plays a crucial role in managing the project's structure and enabling Maven to perform tasks like dependency management, building, and running the application.

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are third-party libraries or frameworks that a project requires in order to function. In Maven, these dependencies are defined in the pom.xml file, and Maven automatically downloads and manages these libraries. Dependency management ensures that the project is using the correct versions of libraries and simplifies the process of keeping those libraries up to date.

## Spring MVC Architecture

Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a popular framework for building web applications. It follows the MVC design pattern, which divides the application into three main components:

### Model

The Model represents the business logic and the data of the application. It typically interacts with the database or data sources to retrieve or persist data. In Spring MVC, the model can be represented as simple Java classes (POJOs) that hold the data and business logic.

### View

The View is what the user interacts with. It is responsible for presenting data to the user and is typically rendered as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the browser. Views in Spring MVC can either be static (pre-defined HTML) or dynamic (rendered using templates or templates engines like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).

### Controller

The Controller handles incoming requests from users, processes them, and interacts with the Model to fetch or modify data. It then selects the appropriate View to display the results to the user. The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and View components.
